        I'm a full-stack developer and product designer who bridges the gap between
        technical excellence and human-centered design. After 7 years in
        academia mentoring 200+ students at Istanbul Technical University, I
        transitioned to building digital products that solve real problems
        across the entire stack.

        From frontend interfaces to backend systems, I craft solutions using
        React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. My approach
        combines rigorous testing methodology with hands-on development
        experience, always keeping accessibility and user needs at the
        forefront. Whether it's writing clean code or conducting usability
        research, I focus on creating experiences that truly serve people.
